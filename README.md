# IndexITunesStore

## Description

The project is about a page that performs digital content search through a header for the ITunes Store API.

The project has a search engine with text, a droplist with different types of digital content and a button to search the placed selectors. 

As a result of the searches the program will return the desired content in the form of cards containing the image, the name of the content, the name of the artist, the price and the link to access the content (some must have an ITunes Store account). The project has only one view.
